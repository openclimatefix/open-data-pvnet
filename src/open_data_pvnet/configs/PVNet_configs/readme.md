This directory contains example configuration files for the PVNet project. Many paths will need to unique to each user. You can find these paths by searching for PLACEHOLDER within these logs. Not all of
the values with a placeholder need to be set. For example in the logger subdirectory there are many different loggers with PLACEHOLDERS. If only one logger is used, then only that placeholder needs to be set.

run experiments by:
`python run.py experiment=example_simple `
